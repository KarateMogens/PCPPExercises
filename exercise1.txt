Exercise 1.1 - PCPP - Deadlock

1. ThemainmethodcreatesaLongCounterobject.Thenitcreatesandstartstwothreadsthatrunconcurrently, and each increments the count field 10 million times by calling method increment.
What output values do you get? Do you get the expected output, i.e., 20 million?

-- When running the programme, we get different outputs each time the programme is run, all being under 20 million. 

2. Reduce the counts value from 10 million to 100, recompile, and rerun the code. It is now likely that you get the expected result (200) in every run.
Explain how this could be. Is it guaranteed that the output is always 200?

-- Since the runtime of each thread is so short, in most cases t1 will finish the complete execution of the for-loop, before t2 is even started. Therefore you don't have any data being overwritten. This is because the process of starting a new thread is a quite heavy operation in itself.

- It is not guaranteed, that we will get an output of 200 each time. The first rerun executed with the output 188.
